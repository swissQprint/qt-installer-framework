    \title Getting Started

    Qt Installer Framework is developed as part of the Qt project. The
    framework itself uses Qt. However, it can be used to install all kind of
    applications, including (but not limited to) applications built with Qt.

    \section1 Supported Platforms

    You can use the Qt Installer Framework to create installers for all
    platforms supported by \l[QtDoc]{Supported Platforms}{desktop Qt}.

    The installers have been tested on the following platforms:

    \list
        \li Microsoft Windows 7, and later
        \li Ubuntu Linux 16.04, and later
        \li macOS 10.12, and later
    \endlist

    \section1 Building from Sources

    The following steps describe how to build the Qt Installer Framework
    yourself. You can skip this if you have downloaded a pre-built version
    of the framework.

    \section2 Supported Compilers

    The Qt Installer Framework can be compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio
    2013 and newer, GCC 4.7 and newer, and Clang 3.1 and newer. Currently, the
    tested combination for Windows is Qt 5.12.4 with MSVC 2015.

    \section2 Configuring Qt

    If you use a statically built Qt to build the Qt Installer Framework
    you do not have to deliver Qt libraries, which enables you to distribute
    installers as one file. Please read SSL Import and Export Restrictions
    from http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/ssl.html if you are statically linking against
    OpenSSL libraries.

    The supported Qt version is 5.12.7.

    \section3 Configuring Qt for Windows

    We recommend that you use the following options when you configure Qt for
    Windows:

    \code
    configure -prefix %CD%\qtbase -release -static -static-runtime -accessibility -no-icu -no-sql-sqlite -no-qml-debug -nomake examples -nomake tests

    \endcode

    Build Qt:
    \code
    nmake (or 'mingw32-make') module-qtbase module-qtdeclarative module-qttools module-qttranslations module-qtwinextras
    \endcode

    \section3 Configuring Qt for Linux

    We recommend that you use the following configuration options for Linux:

    \code
    configure -prefix $PWD/qtbase -release -static -accessibility -qt-zlib -qt-libpng -qt-libjpeg -qt-xcb -qt-pcre -no-glib -no-cups -no-sql-sqlite -no-qml-debug -no-opengl -no-egl -no-xinput2 -no-sm -no-icu -nomake examples -nomake tests -no-libudev
    \endcode

    Build Qt:
    \code
    make module-qtbase module-qtdeclarative module-qttools module-qttranslations
    \endcode

    \section3 Configuring Qt for macOS

    We recommend that you use the following configuration options for macOS:

    \code
    configure -prefix $PWD/qtbase -release -static -no-securetransport -accessibility -qt-zlib -qt-libpng -qt-libjpeg -no-cups -no-sql-sqlite -no-qml-debug -nomake examples -nomake tests -no-freetype
    \endcode

    Build Qt:
    \code
    make module-qtbase module-qtdeclarative module-qttools module-qttranslations
    \endcode

    \section2 Setting up Qt Installer Framework

    \list 1

        \li Clone the Qt Installer Framework source code from
            \l{http://code.qt.io/cgit/installer-framework/installer-framework.git/}
            to get the sources for the tools.

        \li Build the tools by running the "qmake" from the static Qt, followed by "make" or "nmake".

    \endlist

    \note To contribute patches to Qt Installer Framework, follow the standard
    Qt processes and guidelines. For more information, see
    \l{http://wiki.qt.io/Contribute}{Contribute to Qt}.
